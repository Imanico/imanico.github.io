What can text mining tell us about aesthetics, design and the construction of "place" in contemporary politics of travel and interior design?
Is there a way to textualize information on aesthetics, design and locale in order to understand how places are
perceived, constructed, and reproduced both virtually and materially. In addition, I am curious to understand the
relationship between 'sense of self' and sense of place. Specifically, the relationship between subjecthood and perception
of place- the ways in which race, class, and gender influence the perception and experience of "place".ltimately my curiosity begs the question how can aesthetics, design and politics of "place" both virtually and materially inform us about
capitalism and coloniality.
This year marks the publication of Afrøpean’s second year as a web-based multimedia platform. Afrøpean is a
digital community dedicated to highlight the social, cultural, and aesthetic practices of Afro- descendant
Europeans. However, the minimalist gallery-like interface, stark photo displays, and myriad of testimonies,
travel literature and journalism alike interrogating what being black beyond African borders means is not unique
to Afrøpean. Afrøpean, although a stand-alone digital community is in dialogue with a larger network of contemporary
digital platforms whose multimedia and multi-disciplinary work extend beyond national boundaries and foreground what
is now being called the Afropean movement in Europe and the Black Travelers movement in North America.
In a similar light, contemporary Afro American cultural expression has also turned to web-based media as a medium to
discuss the intersection of race and space through digital travel narratives. Although Afro Americans have a history of
travel narratives this new wave uses similar aesthetics as the Afro European digital platform to negotiate
their position as both American and a member of the African Diaspora by traveling beyond the borders of
birth to distinguish between “place” and “role”, and the properties of modernity that overdetermined and
subjugate their black identity in America. The genre and aesthetic was recently coined the modern black
traveler’s movement. For both the digital including social media, YouTube, personal and group web-based
platforms alike offer an alternative space for visibility, commentary and solidarity. The aesthetics and
host of questions concerning race and the role of place running through each movement begs the question
how the digital serves as an alternative space to further interrogate the conceptualization of blackness
and the politics of place; what is the work of the digital, that is what kind of new relations it affords?
Methodology
The politics of place via aesthetics, design, and travel lead me to two different pools of literature.
Contemporary home and design magazines: BID,crate and barrel, Ikea, Pottery Barn, Home & Design, Elle Decoration, Dwell,
Digital platforms for black travel: Nomadness,Travel Noire,Brown Girls Fly, Afropean, "Strolling"
Virtual social movements and their use of hashtags
For the purpose of the class I used Voyont tools to investigate the language on the home pages of two digital platforms for black travel
: Travel Noire and Nomaness Travel Tribe. It was mostly exciting to to see the pages transform and ake other shapes
beyond the minimalist aesthetic I am accustomed to. In a way it provided me with the language of the aesthetics
