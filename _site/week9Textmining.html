<p>What can text mining tell us about the construction of —place”? What about landscape of virtual social resistance?
In other words how can we both visualize and textualize information on aesthetics,design and locale in order to understand
how places are perceived, constructed, and reproduced both virtually and materially. In addition, I am curious to understand the
relationship between ‘sense of self’ and sense of place. Specifically, the relationship between subjecthood and perception
of place- the ways in which race, class, and gender influence the perception, experience and sense of role in “place”.Ultimately
my curiosity begs the question, how does interrogating the politics of place via aesthetics, design, travel and resistance both
virtually and materially inform us about modern forms of capitalism and coloniality.</p>

<p>
This year marks the publication of Afrøpean’s second year as a web-based multimedia platform. Afrøpean is a
digital community dedicated to highlight the social, cultural, and aesthetic practices of Afro- descendant
Europeans. However, the minimalist gallery-like interface, stark photo displays, and myriad of testimonies,
travel literature and journalism alike interrogating what being black beyond African borders means is not unique
to Afrøpean. Afrøpean, although a stand-alone digital community is in dialogue with a larger network of contemporary
digital platforms whose multimedia and multi-disciplinary work extend beyond national boundaries and foreground what
is now being called the Afropean movement in Europe and the Black Travelers movement in North America.</p>
<p>
In a similar light, contemporary Afro American cultural expression has also turned to web-based media as a medium to
discuss the intersection of race and space through digital travel narratives. Although Afro Americans have a history of
travel narratives this new wave uses similar aesthetics as the Afro European digital platform to negotiate
their position as both American and a member of the African Diaspora by traveling beyond the borders of
birth to distinguish between “place” and “role”, and the properties of modernity that overdetermined and
subjugate their black identity in America. The genre and aesthetic was recently coined the modern black
traveler’s movement. For both the digital including social media, YouTube, personal and group web-based
platforms alike offer an alternative space for visibility, commentary and solidarity. The aesthetics and
host of questions concerning race and the role of place running through each movement begs the question
how the digital serves as an alternative space to further interrogate the conceptualization of blackness
and the politics of place- what is the work of the digital, that is what kind of new relations it affords? </p>

Methodology </p>
<p>
My interest to understand capitalism and coloniality through the politics of "place" (aesthetics, design, resistance and travel)
lead me to different pools of literature. Contemporary home and design magazines: BID,crate and barrel, Ikea, Pottery Barn, Home &amp; Design, Elle Decoration, Dwell,
Digital platforms for black travel: Nomadness,Travel Noire,Brown Girls Fly, Afropean, "Strolling" Virtual social movements and their use of hashtags
For the purpose of this weeks class I used Voyont tools to investigate the language on the home pages of two digital platforms for
black travel: Travel Noire and Nomaness Travel Tribe. It was mostly exciting to to see the pages transform and take other shapes
beyond the minimalist aesthetic I am accustomed to.The word clouds and word trends graph where helpful at face value
but I am not sure how far it will get me. For instance, by analyzing the word clouds from each website I was able to see popular word
choices on the entry page of the site. In other words, the vocabulary they were each using to introduce the reader to the
concept of travel as a lifestyle and way of being and performing blackness in the diaspora. For Travel Noire words like:
culture, destination, Africa, Asia, Festival, Jakarta, African, capital, discover, escape were frequently used on the entry page.
While for Nomadness Travel Tribe words like: comment, travel, January, nomadness,, tribe, December, February were more prevalent.
If reading from the words selection alone I can tell the entry page for Nomadness is interactive and keeps a monthly schedule
for events. While Travel Noire appears to be selling wonder lust. However, this could also be recognized by simply going on the
respected sites. In this case, I am unsure how far word clouds and word trend graphs will be insightful for my research questions.
Perhaps topic modeling would work best if I examined individual post about a trip to the same location. From there I can see
the difference in word choice describing one locale. </p>
