    <p>The Syllabus was right, mapping with Google Maps is easy and convenient. Although my own research has some curiosities about the inner workings of “place making” maps are not integral to my research. I feel Google Maps is a great entry point into thinking about interactions through and in space from a geographical perspective without being overburdened by the technicalities of geo-space making through data.<br />
With that being said, my google map exercise was inspired by previous class readings, in particular week three on digital publishing and the public academic as well as last week’s “What is spatial history?” by Richard White. I used this mapping exercise to think through a spatial CV. By this I mean I am mapping out where I did previous research as an undergraduate- the different institutions and using the tabs to describe the nature of the work I did there. I hope my idea of the spatial CV will first make approaching someone’s work history a little more exciting but also offer a little more information that the regular CV cannot (we will find out through this post). So, I obviously will not do my entire CV but as I said before I will map out the section in my CV that says, “research experience” combining both my experiences as an undergraduate. Here we go…</p>

<p>First I followed the tutorial provided on the course syllabus to open and start my map. Then I begin plugging in locations. This first screen shot is of me adding Stanford University where I did a summer research program in my junior year at the City College of New York. Adding a pin consist of typing in the locale and then clicking the tear drop shaped symbol that says add location when hovering above it.<br />
The second screen shot is of the final map. Although I am still not sure what can be learned differently I do think seeing the spatial layout of my undergraduate learning expeditions has a different affect then listed on a CV. The visualization perhaps intensifies the information and allows for the reader to explore the landscape around each institution i’ve been too. And if I went into further detail about the locations in Paris I did my fieldwork it could allow the reader to virtually investigate the landscape as well.</p>

<p>In terms of if having a spatial CV as an alternative CV making it could run the risk of not being practical. For example, the time restraints of job committees who may not want to explore a CV but rather be told in a linear fashion the accomplishment of the candidate. In other words, although this potential shift in CV making excites me I am not sure how practical it is.</p>
