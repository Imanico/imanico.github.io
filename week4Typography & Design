Ellen Lupton’s Thinking with Type is insightful,artful and cheeky.
The combination of historical background on typography, “how to” attitude  and
the examples embedded within the visual/reading experience Thinking with Type
fordges a genre space to discuss design-techno-visual history, and praxis learning.
From my praise of the text above I hope it is visible that my reading experience
was delightful. Although at times the text fell into a lull, overall I found it
to be an interesting way to get aquanted with typography. In particular,
I am most excited to explore with the mixing of typefaces, especially
multiple-family mixes. Multiple- family mixes seems to be a cool way to create
a signiture design or aesthetic that is both unique, classic and effective.
On another note the “how to” tutorial on font and typeface was also a very
comfortable read. Although I think I understand most of the reading in
chapter 6 I have yet to put it in practice. However, one question I do have
is what does the coding process look like to use multiple-family mixes on a
website. For example if the <head> was on typeface but the <body> balanced
between multiple. I look forward to putting tis into practice.
