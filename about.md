Hey, thanks for dropping by.
My name is Imani Cooper-Mkandawire. I am part artist, part academic. Currently,
I am a PhD student in the department of Comparative Literature and the Digital Studies Certificate Program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests focuses on expressions of modern capitalism through materialism, technology and identity politics, sensory learning, new media and the reproduction of pop culture. As for my artistic pursuits, I write poetry, craft furniture out of reclaimed wood, and dabble in visual media. <br/>

Born and raised in New York, I am attracted to global cities and organized chaos.
Travel is my muse, it ignites a deep curiosity that carries over into both my academic and artistic practices. Generally, I like to keep a symbiosis between scholarship and creative innovation, theory and practice. My site is largely experimental and I hope to virtualize an aesthetic that can reflect my praxis.
